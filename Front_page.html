                    <h3> Web Development</h3>
                    <p> One of my main interests is web development. I am currently learning frontened development and
                        am learning reactjs, but I also want to learn backened development. I want to be a full-stack developer, and master 
                        both sides. Infact, this very website you are looking at was coded by me using HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

                    <h3> Mobile Development </h3>
                    <p> Another one of my interests is mobile app development. Along with web development
                        I want to be involved in the frontened and backened process of making maps. I have already started learning Kotlin
                        for android app development and am following an online course. I hope to contribute my app development skills to a company
                        in the future. I also am working towards making my own app for fun.

                <p> Hello everybody, my name is Stephane and I have been on this earth for 19 years so far. 
                    I found my love for Computer Science back in highschool. I love the independence aspect 
                    and problem solving aspect of programming. I am good at debugging and finding errors in 
                    my code. 
                </p>
                <p> I like doing projects whether their school projects or personal projects, because
                    in the end I will have accomplished something wonderful. I am currently attending
                    the University of Maryland College park as a Computer Science major. Currently I am 
                    in search of an internship to gain professional experience. If you think I would 
                    be a good candidate for your company/startup, consider me the best Software Engineer in the world. </p>
